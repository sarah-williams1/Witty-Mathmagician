# Witty-Mathmagician
Capstone project for MSSA.

Witty Mathmagician is a mobile and desktop application designed for young learners. The idea behind this app is to help kindergarten and first-grade students become better at math.
The initial release will only feature shapes, addition, and subtraction.
Later renditions will include more complex math, including multiplication, long division, and fractions.
